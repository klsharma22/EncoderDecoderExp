    "## Flowchart\n",
    "\n",
    "The following flowchart shows roughly how the neural network is constructed. It is split into two parts: An encoder which maps the source-text to a \"thought vector\" that summarizes the text's contents, which is then input to the second part of the neural network that decodes the \"thought vector\" to the destination-text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural network cannot work directly on text so first we need to convert each word to an integer-token using a tokenizer. But the neural network cannot work on integers either, so we use a so-called Embedding Layer to convert each integer-token to a vector of floating-point values. The embedding is trained alongside the rest of the neural network to map words with similar semantic meaning to similar vectors of floating-point values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the Danish text \"der var engang\" which is the beginning of any fairytale and literally means \"there was once\" but is commonly translated into English as \"once upon a time\". We first convert the entire data-set to integer-tokens so the text \"der var engang\" becomes [12, 54, 1097]. Each of these integer-tokens is then mapped to an embedding-vector with e.g. 128 elements, so the integer-token 12 could for example become [0.12, -0.56, ..., 1.19] and the integer-token 54 could for example become [0.39, 0.09, ..., -0.12]. These embedding-vectors can then be input to the Recurrent Neural Network, which has 3 GRU-layers. See Tutorial #20 for a more detailed explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last GRU-layer outputs a single vector - the \"thought vector\" that summarizes the contents of the source-text - which is then used as the initial state of the GRU-units in the decoder-part.\n",
    "\n",
    "The destination-text \"once upon a time\" is padded with special markers \"ssss\" and \"eeee\" to indicate its beginning and end, so the sequence of integer-tokens becomes [2, 337, 640, 9, 79, 3]. During training, the decoder will be given this entire sequence as input and  the desired output sequence is [337, 640, 9, 79, 3] which is the same sequence but time-shifted one step. We are trying to teach the decoder to map the \"thought vector\" and the start-token \"ssss\" (integer 2) to the next word \"once\" (integer 337), and then map the word \"once\" to the word \"upon\" (integer 640), and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "This flow-chart depicts the main idea but does not show all the necessary details e.g. regarding the loss function which is also somewhat complicated."

    "## Conclusion\n",

    "This tutorial showed the basic idea of using two Recurrent Neural Networks in a so-called encoder/decoder model to do Machine Translation of human languages. It was demonstrated on the very large Europarl data-set from the European Union.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model could produce reasonable translations for some texts but not for others. It is possible that a better architecture for the neural network and more training epochs could improve performance. There are also more advanced models that are known to improve quality of the translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that these models do not really understand human language. The models have no knowledge of the actual meaning of the words. The models are merely very advanced function approximators that can map between sequences of integer-tokens."

    "* Train for more than 10 epochs. Does it improve the translations?\n",
    "* Increase the size of the vocabulary. Does it improve the translations? Would it make sense to have different sizes for the vocabularies of the source and destination languages?\n",
    "* Find another data-set and use it together with Europarl.\n",
    "* Change the architectures of the neural network, for example change the state-size for the GRU layers, the number of GRU layers, the embedding-size, etc. Does it improve the translations?\n",
    "* Use hyper-parameter optimization from Tutorial #19 to automatically find the best hyper-parameters.\n",
    "* When translating texts, instead of using `np.argmax()` to sample the next integer-token, could you sample the decoder's output as if it was a probability distribution instead? Note that the decoder's output is not softmax-limited so you have to do that first to turn it into a probability-distribution.\n",
    "* Can you generate multiple sequences by doing this sampling? Can you find a way to select the best of these different sequences?\n",
    "* Disable the reversal of words for the source-language. Does it improve the translations?\n",
    "* What is a Bi-Directional GRU and can you use it here?\n",
    "* We use the **output** of the encoder's GRU as the initial state of the decoder's GRU. The research literature often uses an LSTM instead of the GRU, so they used the encoder's **state** instead of its output as the initial state of the decoder. Can you rewrite this code to use the encoder's state as the decoder's initial state? Is there a reason to do this, or is the encoder's output sufficient to use as the decoder's initial state?\n",
    "* Is it possible to connect multiple encoders and decoders in a single neural network, so that you can train it on different languages and allow for direct translation e.g. from Danish to Polish, German and French?\n",
    "* Explain to a friend how the program works."
