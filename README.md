# EncoderDecoderExp
 Recreating Encoder Decoder Architecture to understand the working


# Dependencies required

The dependencies required for this experiment is in the `requirement.txt`. Create a new environment using ` conda create --name <new_env>` and install the the dependencies using `pip install -r requirement.txt`

# Agenda of this project
The main agenda of this project is to understand the architecture, training procedure and implementation of Google's Encoder Decoder NMT (Neural Machine Translation) from *Googleâ€™s Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation*. Will try in their dataset and after completely understanding the mechanism, we will try to train the model using other language pair to see the performance.
